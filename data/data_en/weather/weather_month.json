Rainwater harvesting is also encouraged in areas expected to receive rainfall. Conversely, the water catchment areas in the Highlands West and East of the Rift Valley are expected to receive above-average rainfall. As a result, the water levels in the dams and rivers within these catchment areas are likely to be maintained, ensuring a stable water supply for various uses, including agriculture, domestic consumption, and hydropower generation."

    "question": "What environmental impacts are expected for the upcoming month?",
    "answer": "The expected above-average rainfall over the Highlands West of the Rift Valley, the Lake Victoria Basin, and the Central and Southern Rift Valley is set to significantly enhance soil moisture, creating optimal conditions for tree and vegetation growth. This is a key opportunity to support the National Tree Growing and Restoration Campaign, which aims to grow 15 billion trees by 2032 and increase the tree cover from the current 12% to 30% by 2032. The increased soil moisture will improve the survival rates of newly planted trees and promote the expansion of forested areas. By capitalizing on these favorable conditions, the public can play a crucial role in this campaign. Engaging in tree planting initiatives not only contributes to achieving the national tree cover target but also has a substantial environmental impact. Increased tree cover will enhance air quality, boost biodiversity, prevent soil erosion, and aid in carbon sequestration, thus mitigating climate change. Moreover, the enhanced forest cover will support ecosystem services, safeguard water resources, and contribute to a more resilient environment for future generations."
