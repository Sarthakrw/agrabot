      "question": "What is Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses?",
      "answer": "Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), also known as Cassava brown streak viruses, is a disease caused by two viruses: Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). These viruses belong to the genus Ipomovirus in the family Potyviridae. The disease affects cassava plants, causing severe yield losses by damaging leaves, stems, and roots."

    {
      "question": "What are the symptoms of Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses on cassava leaves?",
      "answer": "Symptoms of Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) on cassava leaves include yellow patches mixed with normal green areas (chlorosis), characteristic yellow or necrotic vein banding that can enlarge to form large yellow or necrotic patches. These symptoms are more prominent on mature (lower) leaves than on younger ones. In some cases, the symptoms may appear and disappear in young plants but reappear at a later stage."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses affect cassava stems?",
      "answer": "Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) causes dark brown streaks and spots on cassava stems, with dead spots on leaf scars. The disease can also cause shoot tip death, leading to cassava stem die-back in severe cases. These brown streaks are most prominent on the upper, green portions of the stem."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the effects of Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses on cassava roots?",
      "answer": "Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) causes cracks and discoloration in cassava storage roots. It leads to root constriction and malformation, with yellow-brown necrotic spots appearing on harvested roots. In susceptible varieties, the disease causes a dry, hard rot which is irregular and most pronounced at the edges of the root when cut across with a knife."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses spread?",
      "answer": "Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) spreads primarily through the planting of cassava cuttings from infected plants. The disease is also graft transmissible and spread by the whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci. Sharing and distribution of infected planting materials can cause rapid spread of the disease in new areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "What vectors are responsible for transmitting Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses?",
      "answer": "The primary vector responsible for transmitting Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) is the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. This insect spreads the virus from infected plants to healthy ones, facilitating the disease's rapid spread."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I prevent the spread of Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses in my farm?",
      "answer": "To prevent the spread of Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), use disease-free planting materials, regularly inspect cassava plants for symptoms, and promptly remove and destroy any infected plants. Additionally, manage whitefly populations to reduce the spread of the virus and avoid sharing or distributing infected planting materials."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any cassava varieties resistant to Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses?",
      "answer": "Yes, some cassava varieties have shown tolerance to Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD). In Kenya, tolerant varieties include Siri, Shibe, Tajirika, and Nzalauka. Using these varieties can help reduce the impact of the disease on cassava production."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the impact of Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses on cassava yield?",
      "answer": "Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) can significantly impact cassava yield by causing extensive damage to leaves, stems, and roots. The disease can lead to root necrosis, reducing the marketable yield and causing severe economic losses for small-scale producers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses be eradicated?",
      "answer": "Eradicating Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) is challenging due to its efficient spread through planting materials and vectors. However, implementing strict control measures, such as using disease-free planting materials, managing whitefly populations, and avoiding the distribution of infected cuttings, can help manage and reduce the disease's impact."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I detect Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses early in my cassava plants?",
      "answer": "Early detection of Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) involves regularly inspecting cassava plants for symptoms such as chlorosis, necrotic vein banding on leaves, and brown streaks on stems. Monitoring the plants at different growth stages and paying attention to the appearance of any unusual symptoms can help in early detection."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the common names for Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses?",
      "answer": "Common names for Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) include Cassava brown streak virus, Cassava brown streak carlavirus, Cassava brown streak potyvirus, and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I manage Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses in my cassava crop?",
      "answer": "Managing Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) involves using disease-free planting materials, selecting tolerant varieties, regularly inspecting plants for symptoms, removing and destroying infected plants, and controlling whitefly populations. Additionally, avoiding the distribution of infected planting materials is crucial."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses affect other crops?",
      "answer": "Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) primarily affects cassava plants. However, other species in the Manihot genus, such as Ceara Rubber (Manihot glaziovii), can also be affected. It is essential to focus control measures on cassava crops to prevent the disease's spread."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can I get disease-free cassava planting materials to prevent Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)/Cassava brown streak viruses?",
      "answer": "Disease-free cassava planting materials can be obtained from certified sources such as the KEPHIS Plant Quarantine Station in Kenya. These materials are tested to ensure they are free from Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) and other pathogens, providing a reliable starting point for healthy cassava cultivation."
