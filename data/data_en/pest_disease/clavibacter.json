  {
    "question": "How can I use cultural practices to manage Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis/the bacterial canker of tomato?",
    "answer": "Cultural practices to manage Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, or bacterial canker of tomato, include crop rotation with non-host crops, removing and destroying infected plant debris, using resistant tomato varieties if available, and maintaining proper spacing between plants to reduce humidity and the likelihood of infection."
  },
  {
    "question": "What chemical control options are available for Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis/the bacterial canker of tomato?",
    "answer": "Chemical control options for Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, or bacterial canker of tomato, include the use of copper-based bactericides and antibiotics. These should be applied as part of an integrated pest management strategy, and their use should follow local regulations to prevent resistance development and environmental impact."
  },
  {
    "question": "What impact does Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis/the bacterial canker of tomato have on fruit quality?",
    "answer": "Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, or the bacterial canker of tomato, impacts fruit quality by causing white, raised spots and streaks on the fruit surface. Infected fruits may also exhibit internal necrosis, making them unmarketable and leading to economic losses for producers."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can I detect Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis/the bacterial canker of tomato in stored produce?",
    "answer": "Detecting Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, or the bacterial canker of tomato, in stored produce involves inspecting tomatoes for signs of white, raised spots and internal discoloration. Laboratory tests, such as PCR and culturing techniques, can confirm the presence of the bacteria in suspected samples."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the quarantine measures for Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis/the bacterial canker of tomato?",
    "answer": "Quarantine measures for Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, or the bacterial canker of tomato, include restrictions on the movement of infected plants and plant materials. Implementing strict sanitation protocols, inspecting and certifying seeds and transplants, and following regulatory guidelines are essential to prevent the spread of the pathogen."
