    "question": "What are aphids, also known as plant lice or greenflies, and why are they significant pests for crops in Kenya?",
    "answer": "Aphids, also known as plant lice or greenflies, are small, soft-bodied insects from the family Aphididae. They are significant pests for many crops in Kenya due to their ability to feed on plant sap using needle-like mouthparts. This feeding leads to curled leaves, stunted growth, and reduced yields. Aphids can also transmit plant viruses, causing further damage. Their rapid reproduction, especially in warm and dry conditions, makes infestations difficult to control. They are often indicated by the presence of black ants and sooty mold on plants."

    "question": "How do aphids, also known as plant lice or greenflies, reproduce and spread on crops?",
    "answer": "Aphids, also known as plant lice or greenflies, have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. In warm regions like Kenya, aphids reproduce asexually, with females giving birth to live nymphs rather than laying eggs. A single female can produce 20 to over 100 nymphs, which mature into adults in about one week. They live in colonies and spread by producing winged individuals that migrate to new plants, often carried by the wind."
